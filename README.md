# TLA (Time Lag Accumulator) - delay/feedback system for Organelle M

Original implimetation consisted of two tape recorders, the first writing incoming siganl to tape and the second playing the recording back. The distance between the machinesdetermined the delay time between recording and playback. The system was created for Terry Riley by a studio engineer and elaborated upon by later experimental and ambient artists.

This version was created as a patch for the Organelle M.
